							<p>Hi, my name is Nyree Mason. I'm from Montgomery, AL and attended the historic Tuskegee University. I received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering in May of 2020. During my time at Tuskegee University, I had the pleasure of working as an undergraduate research assistant. I conducted a two-year study centered around engineering education. I collected, cleaned, and transformed data to draw useful insights using Excel. After graduation, I was granted the opportunity to join JPMorgan & Chase's 1st Underwriting Leadership Development Program. </p>
							<p>At Chase, I had the chance to develop my skills as a leader and team member. Regularly, I would think back to how much I enjoyed my analysis experience in college. While I was grateful for the opportunity at Chase, I eventually decided to try and pivot into a career in data analytics. I started with the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. The courses allowed me to gain proficiency using Sheets, BigQuery, SQL, Tableau, and R.  </p>
							<p>Currently I work at RTI Internation as a Data Specialist part-time but I'm open to other opportunities. You can now follow me here as I dive deeper into the world of data analytics. My website will be updated weekly with new projects. I'll be exploring different datasets and programs. Thanks for stopping by and you can follow me on my socials below! </p>
